# no this is what i learnt. i actually learnt about while loops and whole lot of debugging! this time round i really understood that i dont know anything. i couldnt actually do something that was in beginner level that was said to be intermediate, hopefully thats why.. i couldnt do it and i felt that i am not improving at all. cus i have been at this for kinda long now and havent had much progress of all of these. Everything tends to be just going on and nothing seems to be working out now. idk what is this im feeling and all but this is not what i sould be while i am coding becuz i actually do love it and kida think i am good at it. not like good but can get and grasp things fast because i like it. but then reality hits.

while 1:
    for i in s:

            s.replace("_",'p')
#okay this is not what i came for the project of this day is finished in a site named reeborgs world where i completed 4 hurdles and a maze and also the 3 debugging world which i could not do. but did understand after the solution was showed
